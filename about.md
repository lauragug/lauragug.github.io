My background is in mechanical engineering and in fluid dynamics. During my PhD thesis, developed at the [University of Genova](https://unige.it) and at [MIT](http://oe.mit.edu), I studied how oscillating flapping foils can mimick the swimming motion of carangiform fishes and can be exploited for underwater propulsion. I later joined [Howard Stone](http://www.princeton.edu/~stonelab/)'s group at Harvard University and Princenton University, where I contributed to various problems involving complex fluids in low-Reynolds number regimes, such as transport in porous media and two phase flows for microfluidic applications, thread-like biofilms formation in small geometries. I have been as well research associate at Stanford's [Center for Turbulence Research](https://ctr.stanford.edu), where I looked at vesicles dynamics and particles dispersion in human lungs.
