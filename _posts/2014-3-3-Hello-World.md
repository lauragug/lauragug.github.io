title: Scoring users with RadiumOne
---

RadiumOne is an advertising platform that offers a full spectrum display advertising solution. They serve an agreed upon number of ad impressions at a given cost for the client and, in doing so, hit a pre arranged number of users to go on to purchase the product. RadiumOne proprietary data sources and intelligent targeting algorithms allow them to generate a high conversion rate.
In this project I explore whether it is possible to gain additional value from unsupervised learning on the site space based on the users that visit each site and the shared users between sites.
