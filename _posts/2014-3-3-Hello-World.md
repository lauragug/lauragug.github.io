title: Scoring users with RadiumOne
---

RadiumOne is an advertising platform that offers a full spectrum display advertising solution. They serve an agreed upon number of ad impressions at a given cost for the client and, in doing so, hit a pre arranged number of users to go on to purchase the product. RadiumOne proprietary data sources and intelligent targeting algorithms allow them to generate a high conversion rate.
For my [Insight Data Science](http://insightdatascience.com) Project I collaborated with RadiumOne to explore whether it is possible to gain additional value from unsupervised learning on the site space based on the users that visit each site and the shared users between sites.
